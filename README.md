## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Markdown_
* _Bootstrap_
* _JavaScript_
* _jQuery_

## Description

_This webpage was created as the second project for Epicodus following the JavaScript section in Intro to Programming. The page asks users to enter their name and then answer five questions in order to determine which language they should start learning. Depending on the responses to the five questions, they may or may not need to answer a tie-breaker question to get their result. Javascript and jQuery functions and branching are used to return the result/language and display it to the user._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository from Github and save a copy on own computer_

* _Using GUI or terminal, open cloned project directory (titled language-suggester2) to view files_

* _Using GUI or terminal, open index.html file to view project locally_

* _If needed, stylesheet, js file, and readme can also be opened from project home directory_

* _The Github page for this project: RosarioRu.github.io/language-suggester2_

## Known Bugs

* _The dotted border that surrounds the box that contains the user's results is not hidden succesfully when the first form results in the need of a tie-breaker question. When the user is asked to answer the tie-breaker question, the empty dotted border can be seen on the right-side of the screen._
